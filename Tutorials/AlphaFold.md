# Structure prediction using Colab notebooks

For this tutorial we will use a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) that provides a basic AlphaFold functionality.
The Colab notebook that we will use was created by Sergey Ovchinnikov, Milot Mirdita and Martin Steinegger.

## Before we start ...
1. What is a Colab notebook? 
> *“Colab” is a product from Google Research. \
> Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser [...] More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.*
