# Structure prediction using Colab notebooks

For this tutorial we will use a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) that provides a basic AlphaFold functionality. To use advances features follow this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb).
The Colab notebook that we will use was created by Sergey Ovchinnikov, Milot Mirdita and Martin Steinegger.

## Before we start ...
**1. What is AlphaFold**
> AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence (AI) program developed by Google's DeepMind which performs predictions of protein structure.

> [Quote from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold)

**2. What is a Colab notebook?** 
> *“Colab” is a product from Google Research. \
> Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser [...] More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.*

## Getting started
For this tutorial you will need an amino acid sequence. (Just the sequence, without a sequence header). \
     Here is an example:  \
     `KGKEGKVLKVDPKKGRVVVEGVNGEVEVPIHPSHVRKGDTVKVIAGNKGKEGKVLKVDPKK`
     
Open the following [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) in a new tab.
