# Structure prediction using Colab notebooks

For this tutorial we will use a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) that provides a basic AlphaFold functionality.
The Colab notebook that we will use was created by Sergey Ovchinnikov, Milot Mirdita and Martin Steinegger.
