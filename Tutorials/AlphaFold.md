# Structure prediction using Colab notebooks

For this tutorial we will use a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb) that provides a basic AlphaFold functionality.
The Colab notebook that we will use was created by Sergey Ovchinnikov, Milot Mirdita and Martin Steinegger.

## Before we start ...
1. What is a Colab notebook? \
"Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs."
